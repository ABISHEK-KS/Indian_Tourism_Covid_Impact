Hey there !
This is a small note by K.S.ABISHEK. 
I like data analysis and it all began when my friend taught me matplotlib. That was really fun and i like how i could bring numbers to life by manifesting them into colorful pictures.I am up for internship as well. 
I hope you have a great time looking at my portfolio. 
:)
