Hey there !  


Some changes were made to the existing data because the data cells were found to be empty. Some cells were lacking data values, and they were approximated based on the previous trends in the four quarters of the preceeding years using averages.     

The following cells were approximated using averages

The year 2019 saw a total yearly influx of ~11 Million tourists from the top 50 countries visiting India. But the number dropped to ~3 million in 2020. Well , we all know the culprit .

Covid-19 has significantly impacted the world. An average international tourist visiting India spends around INR 2611 per day (source: www.budgetmytrip.com) , which is around $32 a day.  

Due to Covid-19 , the yearly influx of tourists had been reduced by a staggering ~8 million. Now , simple math will give you a massive number , a loss of at least $254.24 Million , or around INR 20,71,02,63,280.00 , which is more than 2000 crores.  

Now , the question is :Who exactly lost this money ?   

Without a doubt , it's the locals of India . People who rent out accomodations , people who run restraunts , taxi drivers , tour guides who get paid , and anybody who's involved in interacting with international tourists.   

China saws the greatest decrease in influx , a massive 88.34% decrease. Portugal saw the lowest decrease , at (still a massive) 58.52% .

Suprisingly , the first quarter of 2020 sees a big increase in influx , as compared to the first quarter of other years. Events like Namaste Trump and the Bombay International Film Festival could have contributed to this influx.   

The decrease of influx in the subsequent quarters is clearly visible , and the rest is history.
